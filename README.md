# Twitter Data Collection Framework

February 2015

This is the start of a framework for accessing data from Twitter's
REST and Streaming APIs. It comes with several example applications
that demonstrate how to make use of the framework.

This framework was created by Prof. Ken Anderson of the Department of
Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Installation

To install the framework:

1. Download the archive.
2. cd into twitter_framework
3. bundle install
4. There is no step 4.

You can now try out some of the command-line programs that come with
the framework such as get_tweets.rb or find_tweets.rb.

## Assumptions

The above installation instructions assume that you have Ruby 2.X.X
installed and that you also have Bundler installed and that the
`bundle` command is on your path.

## Have Fun!

If you have any questions, send them to Prof. Ken Anderson at CU Boulder.
